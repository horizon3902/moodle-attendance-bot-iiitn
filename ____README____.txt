Attendance Bot for 3rd Semester, IIIT Nagpur

Requirements:
1) Python 3.x+
2) Firefox Browser

Installation:
1) Run setup.bat
2) In the file which opens, replace "Enter Username Here" and "Enter Password Here" with your moodle username and password
   respectively, INSIDE THE QUOTES. SAVE THE FILE.

How to use:
1) Run "runbot.bat" before the working day starts, and KEEP IT OPEN, DO NOT CLOSE IT TILL THE DAY IS OVER.
2) If the bot was started after the class had already begun, IT WILL NOT MARK THE ATTENDANCE, DO IT YOURSELF.
